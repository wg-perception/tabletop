This is a port of the old tabletop to the object recognition infrastructure
Are deprecated:
- ping_tabletop_node.cpp service to just ping the recognition system: that is not needed anymore with the new OR
- tabletop_complete_node.cpp: not necessary anymore

Have not been re-implemented:
- ping_segment_object_in_hand.cpp

Have been modified:
- Shape is now copied from arm_navigation_msgs

Please see http://wg-perception.github.io/tabletop for documentation.
